\chapter{Usage Guide}
\label{chap:usage_guide}
HighwayToSafety is a software designed for a lot of different users with a lot
of different interfaces. However, every user just needs to know how the
interface, that he is going to work with, functions. The coordinators of the
firemen and policemen for instance have to work with a very simple application.
It's easy to use because they eventually work with it on the site of the
accident, where it might be very noisy and chaotic.
The administrators and emergency central work with a little more complex
application, which allows them to manage and organise ressources such as human
ressources, equipment and vehicles.

This section is aimed at describing the general use of each actor by using
procedure descriptions. The description of the processes is organised in a way
to facilitate learning by presenting simpler, more common, or initial processes 
before more complex, less utilised, or subsequent processes.

\section{Actors common procedures}
Common procedures to several actors are grouped in this section to avoid
redundancy.

\subsection{suGlobalManagementOfEvent}
\begin{lyxlist}{UC1}

\item [\textbf{Use~Case:}] suGlobalManagementOfEvent
\item [\textbf{Scope:}] Enterprise level
\item [\textbf{Primary Actor}:] Walter: Human Witness,\\ 
						        Camille: Central Coordinator,\\
								Fabio: Firemen Coordinator,\\
								Ted: Tow-truck driver,\\ 
								Polo: Police Coordinator
\item [\textbf{Secondary Actor}:] Orange: Communication Company
\item [\textbf{Intention:}] The intention of this procedure is to have a new
event\\ registered into the system and have all the required resources\\ arrive
at the accident’s location.
\item [\textbf{Level}:] Summary level
\item [\textbf{Main~Success~Scenario}]:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Walter contacts Camille at the Emergency Central.
  \item Camille sends to CMS to request Walter’s coordinates from Orange.
  \item Orange sends to CMS to receives Walter’s coordinates.
  \item Camille sends to CMS to receive Walter’s coordinates.
  \item Camille fills in the information provided by Walter.
  \item Camille sends to CMS to create a new event associated to Walter
  (1,Walter, Witness, 691123456, http://..., X=75.08,Y=23.03, ``No additional 
  comments'').
  \item CMS sends a request to dispatch a team to the nearest, available Firemen
  Coordinator Fabio.
  \item CMS sends a request to dispatch a tow-truck to the nearest, available
  Tow-truck driver Ted.
  \item Fabio sends to CMS that his team is on its way to the accident’s
  location.
  \item Ted sends to CMS to refresh the map.
  \item Ted sends message to the CMS (``I will arrive in 30 minutes'').
  \item Ted sends to CMS that he is on his way to the accident’s location.
  \item Fabio sends to CMS that his team has arrived at the accident’s
  location.
  \item Fabio sends to CMS that they require a Police Team.
  \item CMS sends a request to dispatch a team to the Police Coordinator Polo.
  \item Polo sends to CMS that his team is on its way to the accidents
  location.
  \item Ted sends to CMS that he has arrived at the accident’s location.
  \item Polo sends to CMS that his team has arrived at the accident’s
  location.

\item [\textbf{Primary Actor}:] Human Witness Sara, Central Coordinator Tim
\item [\textbf{Secondary Actor}:] Communication Company Orange
\item [\textbf{Intention:}]The intention of the Human Witness is to inform the
Urgency Central about an incident and the intention of the Ugency Central Coordinator is
to add the new event to the system.
\item [\textbf{Level}:]User-goal level
\item [\textbf{Main~Success~Scenario}]:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sara instructs the CMS that she wants to contact the Urgency
Central.
\item CMS sends Orange a message of Sara's request including her coordinates.
\item Orange instructs the CMS that it wants to contact the Urgency Central.
\item CMS informs Tim of the call including Sara's coordinates.
\item Tim feeds the CMS with Sara's information.
\item Tim submits the new event to the CMS.
