\subsection{Operating environment}
%Brief overview of the infrastructure on which the software is deployed and
% used.
The department of Fire and Emergeny Service is a critical part of the State
Services that need quick actions and communication in order to minimize the
casualties and inconveniences during emergencies such as car crash, school fire,
etc. \\\\
For the sake of a smooth execution of its tasks, it requires the
cooperation of several other infrastuctures such as the Hospital departments
which are also greatly impacted during emergencies to take care of the injured
and a good communication service between these institutions would also be
required. \\\\
In our scenarios, it most likely also requires to have the cooperation of
the towing service to take care of the broken cars and the Highway maintenance
service to eventually seal off parts of the Highway.

\section{Document structure}  
%Information on how this document is organised and it is expected to be
%used. Recommendations on which members of the audience
%should consult which sections of the document, and explanations about the used
%notation (i.e. description of formats and conventions) must also be provided.
This user-manual is basically split into two parts. \\\\
The first two chapters are meant to introduce the user-manual. Any user should
have a look at these chapters to get a good overview of the manual. \\\\
The second part going from chapter 3 to chapter 5 are the more technical
parts mostly composed of distinct procedures, operations or problems, meaning
that by reading the description of the concerned section, the user should be
able to identify whether it corresponds to their needs. As such, users would
mostly be looking for a procedure in chapter 3 corresponding to their functions
that bears resemblances to their own case and check out the section that
explain in details their part. Otherwise if they encounter any error messages or
problems of the system, they would need to check out chapter 5 for more
information.
Chapter 4 is mainly written for the purpose of understanding how the whole
system works together through different software operations hidden from the
users.
